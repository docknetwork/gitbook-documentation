# Token Migration Support

Dock’s token migration launches tomorrow, please use this blog post as a reference for key points and dates. All Dock token holders must participate in the migration to swap the old ERC20 Dock tokens for new tokens on Dock’s mainnet**.**

Follow the steps in our tutorials to migrate your Dock tokens:

* \*\*\*\*[**Step-by-step guide**](https://docs.dock.io/token-migration/migration-tutorial/migration-tutorial)\*\*\*\*

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**Stay safe -** be very careful when migrating your tokens to follow directions and check all addresses and website URLs to ensure you are migrating correctly.  Unfortunately, migration events are targets for scammers we will not be able to return tokens that are not migrated correctly._
