# FAQ

#### Why is Dock migrating the token?

Dock initially planned to build its protocol using Ethereum and issued the DOCK token using an ERC20 contract. After extensive R&D with Ethereum, the Dock team proposed to move to another network and the community voted to move to the Polkadot interchain ecosystem. Dock has since launched its own blockchain with a  mainnet supported by 11 independent validators. As a next step, the Dock token will be migrated from an ERC20 token to a native token on Dock’s blockchain in order to facilitate transactions, reward validators, governance, and eventually staking on the Dock Network.    


#### What is the Dock ERC20 contract address?

Dock’s original ERC20 contract address is 0xe5dada80aa6477e85d09747f2842f7993d0df71c and can be found on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe5dada80aa6477e85d09747f2842f7993d0df71c).  


#### What is the timeline for the token migration?

The Dock token migration will begin on December 8, 2020, and will continue for three months until March 7, 2021. Dock is offering an incentive for everyone who migrates their tokens in the first four weeks, more information about the bonus incentives can be found [here](https://blog.dock.io/dock-token-migration-part-2-incentives/).   


#### What are the bonus rewards for the token migration?

Dock has two bonus pools with 20 million Dock tokens being allocated to the Swap Pool and 30 million to the Vesting Pool.

* The Swap Pool incentivizes migrating early and will be shared amongst holders that migrate within the first four weeks.
* The Vesting Pool will reward holders who choose to lock 50% of their tokens. These tokens vest at a rate of 33% of lockup every 2 months, so that all of the tokens will vest within 6 months. Participation in this pool is optional for holders migrating in the first four weeks.

#### How do I migrate my tokens if they are on an exchange?

If your Dock tokens are held on any of the following exchanges, there is no action required and these exchanges will exchange your tokens on your behalf. Some of the exchanges may not be ready to migrate immediately. You can also choose to move your tokens off the exchange and migrate them on your own through Dock’s migration portal. This list is continuously updated, so we might add more exchanges later:

* Binance
* Kucoin
* AAX
* BKEX
* Big One

More information about the supporting exchanges can be found [here](https://blog.dock.io/token-migration-part-3/). If you have questions about migrating with an exchange, please contact the exchange directly. If you hold Dock tokens on an exchange that is not listed here, then you will need to migrate your tokens directly with Dock as described [here](https://docs.dock.io/token-migration/migration-tutorial/migration-tutorial). 

#### Which wallets support the new DOCK tokens?

ERC20 wallets will not support the new Dock token, instead holders will have several options for their new Dock tokens:

* [Polkadot-JS app](https://fe.dock.io/#/accounts) is a well-used and tested browser-based wallet that the Dock team has forked and customized for the Dock network. **This is the recommended wallet for most non-technical users.**
* [Parity signer](https://www.parity.io/signer/) can be used for key storage on a mobile device, for extra security the mobile device should be kept offline. 
* [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledger.com/) is a hard wallet and will be supporting the new Dock token soon, the team is submitting a pull request to Ledger to enable new DOCK tokens to be stored on Ledger Nano S in the coming weeks.

More information and instructions on using these wallets with DOCK tokens can be found here {INSERT LINK WHEN READY}.  


#### How can I check if the migration was successful?

You can check the status of your migration by going to {insert link} and entering the ethereum address where you sent your ERC20 tokens from and the transaction hash. Once the migration is complete, your new Dock tokens will be available in your new Dock account.
