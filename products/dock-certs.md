“Dock Certs is extremely easy to use. Because we didn’t have the technical resources to issue Verifiable Credentials to the students that we train, Dock Certs was the perfect solution to issue hundreds of digital graduation certificates that are fraud-proof in just a few clicks. I’m hoping in the coming years, we’ll be issuing tens of thousands of credentials.”—[Greg Twemlow, SEVENmile’s CEO](https://www.dock.io/use-case-sevenmile)

“We use Dock Certs to administer API usage and Dock is far easier to use than other tools. The platform enables us to issue Verifiable Credentials while keeping the integrity of the data intact as data moves within and outside of our health data management system to other stakeholders.”—[Amber Hartley, BurstIQ’s Chief Strategy Officer](https://www.dock.io/use-case-burst-iq)
