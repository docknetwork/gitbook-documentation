[Web3 ID](https://www.dock.io/web3id) is a free blockchain-based authentication and authorization system that puts user privacy first. By using Web3 ID, you’ll enable passwordless login, prevent user tracking, and avoid data collection. With this free integration, organizations can grant access and verify user eligibility by requesting private data directly from users' identity wallet apps and always with their consent.
