These are just a few of the many benefits Verifiable Credentials can provide in the healthcare industry:

* Speed up the verification process to check the qualifications of medical staff including nurses and doctors
* Securely share patient health information with authorized parties with patient consent&#x20;
* Gives patients more ownership, privacy, and control of their health data by choosing who to share their medical history with anyone they choose
* Helps health care providers stay compliant with [data regulations](https://www.dock.io/post/data-compliance) such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR/UK GDPR) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
* Speeds up the issuance of nursing licenses because traditional issuance processes can take weeks to months
* The data is tamper resistant and securely encrypted

### Major Problems in the Healthcare Industry That Verifiable Credential Technology Can Solve

These are just a few of the growing number of ways that Dock’s solutions can enhance the operation and efficiency of healthcare systems. &#x20;

| Despite staffing shortages in hospitals, thousands of qualified nurses aren’t able to work because the issuance of their licenses is taking months. Almost 1 in 10 nurses who were issued new licenses in 2021 [waited six months or more](https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/03/10/nurses-are-waiting-months-for-licenses-hospital-staffing-shortages-spread) in the US.                                                                                  | Verifiable Credentials can significantly speed up the issuance of credentials to nurses. They would be able to carry these credentials anywhere with their phone app and securely share them with any party that needs to verify it like a hospital employer. Job applicants and staff can have a lifelong record of their credentials that can be verified anytime.  |
| <p>One of the biggest challenges in the industry is the secure transfer of patient information. Patient records are often stored in a centralized database making it vulnerable to hacking and other types of data breaches. Often siloed record-keeping systems can result in incomplete and conflicting records. </p><p><br><br></p>                                                                                                                | With Verifiable Credentials, health data is stored on individual devices rather than a centralized database. Health data can be efficiently shared and the verifier can be assured that the information is authentic.                                                                                                                                                 |
| People’s health information is often stored in a variety of places. For example, you might have your primary care physician, specialist, pharmacy, and insurance company all keeping track of different aspects of your health. However, what often happens is that people don't have an easy way to view this information or control who has access to it. As a result, people often don't have ownership and privacy over their health information. | When health records are turned into Verifiable Credentials, patients will have more control, ownership, and privacy over their health data. They can choose when and with whom they want to share their information with and know how their information is being used and by which parties.                                                                           |
