## Verifiable Credential Applications in the Workforce

It takes a lot of time and resources to find good quality candidates and ensure they have the right qualifications for a role. Traditional verification processes are often manual, time-consuming, and require calls to issuing institutions. This process can take weeks or even months. By that time, often top-quality candidates have accepted offers from other organizations. On top of this, organizations often don’t have good tools or the ability to efficiently spot a fake credential.&#x20;

### Benefits of Verifiable Credentials For Organizations and Individuals

**Organizations**

* Employers can save money, time, and resources by verifying credentials instantly in seconds by simply scanning a QR code or using a simple verification tool rather than spending weeks to months recruiting candidates.
* Organizations will know if a credential is legitimate because the issuer’s public key can be checked against their decentralized identifier (DID) which was digitally signed by the issuer&#x20;

**Individuals**

* Candidates can receive digital diplomas, proof of employment, and professional certificates from educational institutions, former employers, and certification-issuing organizations rather than waiting weeks or longer to receive paper versions of these credentials. &#x20;
* They can store, control, and manage all of their credentials from a mobile app like the [Dock Wallet](https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app).

### Use Case 1: Verifying a Required Degree

A tech company is looking for a senior software engineer and requires candidates to have at least a bachelor’s degree in computer science, computer systems engineering, or software engineering.&#x20;

* Issuer: Successo Institute school
* Holder: Leah&#x20;
* Verifier: Tech company

1. Leah completed her Bachelor of Computing Science at Successo Institute and they sent her degree as a Verifiable Credential that she stores in her mobile [Dock Wallet](https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app) app.
2. After she applies for the software engineer position, she is shortlisted and the company sends a request to verify her credential to ensure she has the required degree before proceeding with the interview.
3. She shows them her credential and they can easily scan it with a QR code and instantly see that her degree is authentic.
4. She is scheduled for an interview, passes, and gets the job!

### Use Case 2: Lifelong Record of Achievements, Skills, and Experience

People are continuously learning and gaining experience from both formal educational institutions like college or university and informal experiences like work projects, short courses, and training workshops. Someone’s skills and education can be verified by employers if they are given Verifiable Credentials to reflect the different types of experiences they acquire. These credentials can be easily stored and managed on the Dock Wallet.&#x20;

Let’s say Pam has diverse education and experience. These are the different types of credentials she holds on her mobile wallet:

* Bachelor of Communication&#x20;
* Master of Communication&#x20;
* Project Management Certification
* Professional development workshops including diversity training, conflict management, and public speaking
* Online courses: Marketing automation course, storytelling for persuasion, and ultimate Google Ads training course

### Use Case 3: Verifying Work History

Verifiable Credentials could be used to check someone’s work history. Anyone can lie on a resume to say where they worked and how long they worked there for. But if each employer issued a Verifiable Credential to an employee whenever they leave a position, the next employer can check the legitimacy of the claim.&#x20;

Let’s say Paco organizes all of his work experience credentials with one decentralized identifier (DID) in his Dock Wallet. Every time he leaves a position, the company issues him a Verifiable Credential with details about his job title, how long he worked at the company, his responsibilities, and significant achievements.

* Verifiable Credential 1 shows that he worked from 2016 to 2018 as an event coordinator with company A
* Verifiable Credential 2 shows that he worked from 2018 to 2021 as an event director at company B

Whenever he applies for another job, the employer can request that he show his credentials for his previous job positions. When he shows them this credential, they instantly verify that it is legitimate.
