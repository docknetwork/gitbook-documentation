# Becoming a Validator

### Overview

To become a validator in the PoA testnet, the candidate must submit a short expression of interest form. Dock will contact the applicant and decide whether to accept the application. If the application is accepted, the candidate will submit another form with their blockchain address and validator keys. If the application is rejected, it will be communicated to the candidate. 

The validator can run a few different setups, such as having a single node as a validator. This single node can serve many purposes, including block production, serving client requests, acting as a bootstrap node, but it does not need to perform all of those functions. The validator can also run an additional sentry node for DoS protection which can be used for serving clients or a separate node for serving clients. We advise that running two machines, one for validator and one for sentry, is sufficient for the current state of the network. The sentry can optionally be used as a bootstrap node or serve client requests.

### Application

To become a PoA validator, the validator will submit this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_jjdscJCF9l8hyYnsIa45_EDQ22zk9jiVQiTZI7THb8ozWw/viewform?pli=1) specifying their details for KYV \(Know Your Validator\) once the Dock Association has approved the expression of interest. This includes providing their name, email, location, at least one social profile, and an ID which will vary depending on the location.

If accepted, the validator will receive a confirmation email and need to provide more details to be setup on the network including an account address for receiving rewards block rewards, an Aura public key, a GRANDPA public key, a libp2p ID, and the hostname or IP and the port where the node \(validator or sentry\) will be hosted. In case a validator with a sentry node is being run, the libp2p ID of the sentry node must be shared. These can be generated by running the script `gen_keys_poa_validator` \(LINK TO THE SCRIPT SECTION\). The script will randomly generate an account and both keys.
