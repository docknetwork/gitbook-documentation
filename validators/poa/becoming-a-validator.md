# Becoming a Validator

### Dock is no longer accepting validators for the PoA main net. Interested validators are welcome to join the network when Proof of Stake launches in Q2 2021.

### 

### Overview

To become a validator in the PoA testnet, candidates submitted a short expression of interest form. Dock contacted the applicants and decided whether to accept the applications. If the application was accepted, the candidates submitted another form with their blockchain address and validator keys.

Selected validator can run a few different setups, such as having a single node as a validator. This single node can serve many purposes, including block production, serving client requests, acting as a bootstrap node, but it does not need to perform all of those functions. The validator can also run an additional sentry node for DoS protection which can be used for serving clients or a separate node for serving clients. We advise that running two machines, one for validator and one for sentry, is sufficient for the current state of the network. The sentry can optionally be used as a bootstrap node or serve client requests.

Once you have become a validator, you can see either your account address or your name \(that you permitted us to use\) in the [explorer here](https://fe.dock.io/#/explorer) producing blocks.

### Application

To become a PoA validator, validators submitted a Google form specifying their details for KYV \(Know Your Validator\). This included their name, email, location, at least one social profile, and an ID which will vary depending on the location.

If accepted, the validators received a confirmation email and needed to provide more details, such as; an account address for receiving rewards block rewards,  session key a libp2p ID, and the hostname or IP and the port where the node \(validator or sentry\) will be hosted. In case a validator with a sentry node is being run, the libp2p ID of the sentry node must be shared. These can be generated by running the script `gen_keys_poa_validator` \(from the [key generation section](tooling/key-generation.md)\).
