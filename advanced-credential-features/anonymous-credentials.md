# Anonymous Credentials

Anonymous credentials are a way of enabling people to prove their claims without revealing the information held within the credential in order to preserve their privacy. For example, someone can prove to a liquor store cashier that he is over 18 years old without revealing his birth date. With anonymous credentials, someone doesnâ€™t have to reveal any personally identifiable information.&#x20;
