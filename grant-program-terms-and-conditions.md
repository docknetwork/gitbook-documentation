### **1. Grant Program**&#x20;

The Program invites Dock community members to participate in various development tasks and projects to help develop and grow the Dock network. In return for your Participation, you will be eligible for token compensation (“Reward”, “Rewards”). The Dock team will specify certain tasks that Participants can apply to complete. In addition, program applicants can apply to receive a grant for their own project ideas as long for one or more of the following types of projects:&#x20;

* Applications using Dock’s credentialing technology for specific use cases&#x20;
* Ecosystem components designed to further usage and adoption&#x20;
* Low-level infrastructure development

### **2. Qualifications**

All parties interested in participating in the Program must submit a formal application, undergo a KYC check, and comply with any interview or other requests by the Dock team as part of the application process. By submitting an application, you are confirming that you are fully eligible to participate in the Program and do not have any restrictions or conflicts that would prevent you from participating including, but not limited to, legal or employer restrictions. Information submitted in the application process must be legitimate, submitting false information will result in immediate disqualification from the Program and any Rewards will be forfeited.

Submitting an application and completing the application process does not guarantee that you will be selected as a Participant. The Dock team will be solely responsible for Grant selection based on its discretion. Only Participants who are selected by the Dock team and receive confirmation that they have been selected as a Grant Program Participant will be eligible to participate in the Program and receive Rewards.

Participation in the Program is voluntary and Participants are not considered employees or contractors of Dock, and should not make any claims that they are working directly for Dock. Any misrepresentation of a Participants affiliation with Dock or its partners will be considered a violation of this Agreement and could result in disqualification from the Program.

### 3. Work Quality and License

* Must be original work completed by the individual(s) or company specified on the application.
* Must fulfill the deliverables as agreed between the Participant and the Dock team.&#x20;
* Must be technically sound and code must be at a production level quality&#x20;

### 4. Communication

The Dock team will provide specific channels to be used for communication by Participants to communicate with the Dock team. These channels will be used to communicate updates and important information regarding the Program and active communication is expected by all Participants. If any Participant becomes unresponsive for an extended period of time and the Dock team suspects that they are no longer interested in completing the Program, then the Dock team may consider this Participant as having resigned from the Program.

### 5. Rewards

All Grants will be eligible to receive a Reward in return for their participation in the Program. Specific reward amounts will be determined by the Dock team based on the type of Task being rewarded, and these amounts will be confirmed when the Grant is rewarded.

Rewards are priced in USD amounts and will be paid in Dock tokens upon the completion of each deliverable. The conversion rate for Dock tokens will be determined by using the average closing price for the last 7 days as reported by CoinMarketCap (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dock/). Participants are required to submit the completed work for each deliverable, along with any supplemental documentation, as well as provide a Dock token address.

If any issues are found or the work is incomplete based on the definition of the deliverables, the Dock team may request that the Participant revise the work and resubmit the deliverables until the Dock team is satisfied that the requirements have been met. The Reward will not be paid until the deliverables are fully approved by the Dock team.

Eligibility to receive rewards for various Tasks depends on the following criteria:

* Tasks are completed as instructed, in the case of Custom Projects, as agreed upon between the Dock team and the Participant&#x20;
* Projects and tasks comply with the Program Terms
* Completion of the Tasks are reported to the Dock team and proof of completion is provided as requested
* The Dock team reviews and approves the submitted work
