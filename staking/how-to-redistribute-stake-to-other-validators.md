# How to redistribute stake to other validators

This article explains the process to redistribute stake after a validator or a nominator has already staked their tokens. A step-by-step process is provided for each scenario depending on if you are a validator \(running a node\) or nominator \(staking tokens on behalf of validators\) in the Dock network.

**How to redistribute my stake after I’ve already nominated?**

* There are two ways to redistribute stake by either 1\) changing nominees or 2\) unbonding some of the funds and transferring to a different account for rebonding.

### For nominators who would like to change which validators they are nominating:

1. Go to the [Account actions](https://fe.dock.io/#/staking/actions) page and select 3-dots for your nominator and select the “Set nominees” option.

2. Then add or remove nominees from the modal that appears.

### &gt;&gt; For validators and nominators who would like to unbond a portion of their stake to nominate other validators:

1. Go to the [Account actions](https://fe.dock.io/#/staking/actions) page and select 3-dots for your nominator and select the **Unbond funds** option.
2. On the modal that opens, select the amount you want to unbond. Note that it will take 7 days for the funds to unbond. ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2cbmRcT6KUWmS6uACqdchFx3HGl3PsWKh_mGZCmeUl5E5DxoKaE-NZ1CqLS9EnInJ-fNoZnyXyYX79d5pflpuyi_ZtnK8U8JHBgKPZh9DBof1RN79VSURTlPQHClTAlWmyyCsjnr)
3. After 7 days, revisit this same page, select the 3-dots for your nominator and select the **Withdraw unboned** option. If this option is disabled, then it means 7 days have not happened and try after some time. ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zP0t4-xWL1TNUuTpk4Lke37qL3TEVcvgp_iEfruAl4tOQD2PTuch5n8KQLIMFvcPqJ3ksKQpDJOsiM8XB7dp0fkzgGo_Gtrz51-rqm2wVdJwn213ACpziHiVMtG7Bmi4PfH9DIIU)

Hover over the clock icon to see exactly how long until your stake will be unbonded.

4. Withdraw the amount and transfer it to another of your stash accounts to [nominate a new set of validators](https://docs.dock.io/staking/how-to-nominate-stake-on-dock). Each stash account can only nominate one set of validators.

**Note to validators:** Redistributing your stake to other validators may affect your chances of being selected as a validator as other candidates may out-stake you for the validator spot.
