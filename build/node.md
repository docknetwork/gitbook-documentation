# Node

The blockchain node is built on [Substrate](https://substrate.dev/) and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/docknetwork/dock-substrate). The node can either be built from source or it can be run with Docker using the [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/docknetwork/dock-substrate) at Dockerhub.
