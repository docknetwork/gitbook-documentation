# Build

Dock provides a Substrate node and a Javascript SDK. Dock's first testnet Northhill provides support for:

1. Decentralized Identity \(DID\) in compliance with W3C
2. Verifiable Credentials in compliance with W3C
3. Credential schema using the [JSON schema standard](https://json-schema.org/)
4. Revocation registries to facilitate credential revocation

To use the SDK either run a node locally by cloning it from Github or connect to Northhill's [Websocket RPC endpoint](wss://testnet-node.dock.io:9950). To make writes to the chain, request tokens from the [Faucet](https://faucet.dock.io/).
