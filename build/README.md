Dock provides a Substrate node and a Javascript SDK. Dock's mainnet provides support for:

1. Decentralized Identity \(DID\) in compliance with W3C
2. Verifiable Credentials in compliance with W3C
3. Credential schema using the [JSON schema standard](https://json-schema.org/)
4. Revocation registries to facilitate credential revocation
5. Proof of existence anchors

To use the SDK either run a node locally by cloning it from Github or connect to the testnet's [Websocket RPC endpoint](wss://danforth-1.dock.io/). To make writes to the chain, request tokens from the [Faucet](https://faucet.dock.io/).   
To connect to the mainnet, the Websocket RCP endpoint is [wss://mainnet-node.dock.io](wss://mainnet-node.dock.io).
