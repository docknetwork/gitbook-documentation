# Faucet

The Dock faucet can quickly generate any number of Dock tokens directly from a web interface. These tokens are then available for developers to test smart contract applications and any other token transfer functionality.  
  
Request tokens by entering your Substrate account [here](https://faucet.dock.io/).
