### Mission&#x20;

Dock’s mission is to empower lives through verifiable data by enabling organizations and individuals to create and share validated information.

A tremendous amount of data is online and new information is being added at an astounding rate of 1.145 trillion MB every day! Unfortunately, so much of this information is unverified, meaning that the original data source is unknown, making it impossible to know if it’s trustworthy. Dock was created to address this problem by using leading-edge technology to ensure that the data can be instantly verified. &#x20;

### Problems With Current Data Management and Digital Identity Systems

There have been challenges and limitations with identity management systems since the internet was invented. Centralized identity management in particular has always been vulnerable to threats, cyberattacks, and privacy breaches with a single point of failure. Organizations have spent billions of dollars providing a private and secure space for digital transactions. &#x20;

Another problem is that data often has no protection from being forged. Physical and electronic documents are easy to fake and certificate fraud is a growing problem around the world. Fake diplomas alone are a billion-dollar industry. Certificate fraud can cause injuries, company liabilities, and deaths when unqualified people work in high-stakes positions such as doctors, engineers, or nurses.&#x20;

Centralized and older recordkeeping systems also make it easy for people to manipulate data without anyone else knowing. With centralized and federated digital identity systems (like using a Google account to log into a website or app), people lose control of their information because it can be shared with other parties without their knowledge. User accounts can also be removed by a provider at any time.

### The Solution: Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity

Dock's innovative Verifiable Credential technology can effectively solve all of these problems. We have a convenient user-friendly, no-code platform called Dock Certs to enable organizations to easily issue, manage, verify, and revoke Verifiable Credentials. Our Certs API allows companies to issue Verifiable Credentials from their existing system and allows easy integration for developers.

With the Dock Wallet and Dock Certs, people can create, fully own, and control their digital identity by using decentralized identifiers (DIDs). DIDs allow people to securely manage and share their verified data and no party can take away their DIDs.&#x20;
