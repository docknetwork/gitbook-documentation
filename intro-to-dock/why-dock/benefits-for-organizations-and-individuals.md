Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials are key technology solutions that are part of a decentralized identity management approach. Decentralized identity addresses the problems that often result from centralized and federated identity management systems including the increased risk of data breaches from centralized data storage systems, personal user data being collected, stored, and shared with other parties without people’s knowledge, and data being owned by organizations.&#x20;

These are the key benefits of decentralized identity management for organizations, individuals, and developers:
