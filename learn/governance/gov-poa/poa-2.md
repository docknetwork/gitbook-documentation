# PoA-2

The most significant change in this phase is the introduction of democracy. The changes to the network like validator set changes, approving source-code upgrades, etc that were done by the Master in PoA-1 are done through democratic voting between the Council members. The head of the Council is called the prime member and is elected off-line. Any token holder or a member of the Council can propose a change similar to Polkadot but instead of every token holder voting, only the Council members can vote. A token holder not member of the Council must lock 10K tokens to make a proposal. The lockup amount is only used to prevent spam and does not impact the acceptance or rejection of the proposal and are returned to the proposer once the proposal has been considered. 

There is only one proposal queue unlike two in Polkadot \(and in the PoS phase of Dock\) and every 20 days, a proposal is considered and the Council is expected to vote on the proposal. The voting lasts for 15 days and the members can vote aye \(yes\), nay \(no\) or abstain from voting, with the abstained vote counting the same as the vote of the prime member of the Council. If a proposal is accepted, it is _enacted_, meaning it takes effect in 2 days. However, the technical committee can fast-track the enactment. Also, the Master can cancel any accepted proposal and can unilaterally make changes to the network like PoA-1 but we plan to minimize it. 

The current and past proposals \(with results\) will be listed on Dock's website to be visible to anyone. Any Dock token holder can make a new proposal from Dock's hosted polkadot-js apps UI.
