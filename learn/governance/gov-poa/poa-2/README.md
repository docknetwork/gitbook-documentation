# PoA-2

The most significant change in this phase is the introduction of democracy. Changes to the network such as validator set changes, approving source code upgrades, etc. that were done by the Master in PoA-1 will now be implemented via ever-increasing democratic governance during this phase. Both token holders and Council members can propose changes and the Council members will vote. A token holder who is not a member of the Council must lock 10K tokens to make a proposal. The purpose of the lockup is to prevent spam proposals and does not impact the acceptance or rejection of the proposal. The locked tokens are returned to the proposer once the proposal has been considered. 

There is only one proposal queue in PoA-2 \(this increases to two in the PoS phase\), and every 20 days a proposal is considered and the Council will vote on the proposal. The voting lasts for 15 days and the members can vote aye \(yes\), nay \(no\) or abstain from voting. All votes carry equal weighting. If a proposal is accepted, it is _enacted_, meaning it takes effect in 2 days. However, the technical committee can fast-track the enactment in urgent cases. In addition, the Master can cancel any accepted proposal and can unilaterally make changes to the network like in PoA-1 but the association will limit this as much as possible as the democratic process is clearly the favored approach. 

Current proposals will be publicly [here](https://fe.dock.io/#/democracy) and any Dock token holder will be able to make a new proposal.
