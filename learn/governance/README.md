# Governance



The Dock Governance Framework describes the combination of off-chain and on-chain rules that lets the Dock Corporation \(INSERT NON PROFIT NAME\) and Dock token holders to manage the network. The Dock Association is the custodian of the network and will gradually transfer control to the Dock token holders overtime and thus decentralizing governance of the network in the process. In the beginning, the Dock Corp. can change rules without inviting any proposals \(formal or informal\) from the token holders. As the network matures, Dock Corp. will be part of the Dock Council with independent members who will vote on the proposed changes with the accepted changes making into the network. As the network further matures, anyone can propose changes and token holders vote using their tokens on the proposals. The framework itself will evolve over time in a direction chosen by the token holders.

The network will start with Proof of Authority \(PoA\) consensus but the transition to Proof of Stake \(PoS\) consensus and will have different governance mechanisms. Both PoA and PoS governance will first be launched on testnet and then move to mainnet. We aspire to minimize protocol changes between testnet and mainnet and the only significant difference should be the enhancement of tooling going from testnet to mainnet.

The governance framework manages the network by deciding the

1. Actors in the network and their eligibility criteria and tenure.
2. Configuration parameters
3. Adding, removing or updating the network functionality.
4. Rewards and punishments for different actors in the network.
5. Allocation of financial reserves of the network, i.e. the Treasury.
