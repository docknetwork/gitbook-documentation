# Evolution

The network will launch with PoA consensus \(Aura\) and continue with this mechanism until the development team is ready to integrate the Nominated Proof of Stake \(NPoS\). It is estimated that this will take about 6 months. NPoS is implemented in Substrate and is  being improved on an ongoing basis. The governance will evolve similarly where there would be a Master in the first 2-4 months of launch which will unilaterally make all decisions in the network, like validator set changes, configuration changes, source code upgrades, treasury withdrawals, etc. This will give Dock sufficient time to discover critical issues in the mainnet, get the Council ready both legally and comfortable with using the on-chain governance, select the Technical Committee and start the token migration from Ethereum to Dock chain. 

For the remaining duration of the PoA phase, the Council will use the on-chain governance to propose and vote \(to learn more about the proposal and voting process, see the Voting section\) for the actions the Master was doing. Unlike the PoS phase, there will be only one queue for proposals, for the Council only. Also, the Council members themselves will be elected off-line and not by voting by token holders. The Master will still be active in the network but will take a backseat and only do actions that are very urgent like hotfixes, removing bad validators, etc. The Master can also veto any accepted proposals.

In the PoS phase, the Master role is disabled after ~8M blocks which is about 3 months and removed in the next source code upgrade. The governance will now function with 2 queues, one for proposals by the Council and one by token holders and proposal selection will alternate between the 2 queues. New Council will be elected by the token holders and existing Council members will continue their tenure for the next 6 months. For more details on PoS governance, check [here](gov-pos.md).
