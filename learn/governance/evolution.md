# Evolution

The network will launch with PoA consensus \(Aura\) and continue with this mechanism until the development team is ready to integrate the Nominated Proof of Stake \(NPoS\). It is estimated that this will take about 6 months. NPoS is implemented in Substrate and is  being improved on an ongoing basis. Dock network governance will evolve similarly where there will be a Master in the first 2-4 months of launch which will, in agreement with the council, make all decisions in the network, such as; validator set changes, configuration changes, source code upgrades, treasury withdrawals...etc... This will give Dock sufficient time to; discover and rectify critical issues that may arise in the mainnet, ensure the council is comfortable using on-chain governance, selecting the technical committee as well as starting the token migration from Ethereum to Dock chain. 

For the remaining duration of the PoA phase, the council will use the on-chain governance to propose and vote for the actions as the Master is phased out. Unlike the PoS phase, there will be only one queue for proposals, via the Council only. Additionally, the Council members will be elected off-line and not by voting by token holders, although as we note below this will change to a more democratic process in-time. The Master will still be active in the network but will take a backseat and only carry out actions that are very urgent, such as; hotfixes, removing bad validators...etc... The Master can also veto any accepted proposals. For more details on PoA governance, check [here](gov-poa/).

In the PoS phase, the Master role is disabled after ~8M blocks which is about three months and removed in the next source code upgrade. Network governance will now function with two queues, one for proposals by the Council and one for token holders, and proposal selection will alternate between both queues. New Councilors will be elected by the token holders and existing Council members will continue their tenure which will be capped at 2 years, but can be extended.
