Dock holds 400M of the total 1 billion supply and has committed 200M \(20% of total supply\) to emission rewards which will be released over time on the Dock mainnet. This release will be launched in 2 phases; the first phase is Proof of Authority \(PoA\) where Dock's governing council will select validators based on the validators testnet performance. The second is Proof of Stake \(PoS\) where validators will be selected on the basis of their staked tokens. For more detail on each phase please check the respective documents.
