# Token Economics

Dock has a total supply of 1 billion tokens‌ on its mainnet which plays a key role in aligning participants in the Dock network.

**Token holders**

Currently, token holders hold about 65% of total Dock tokens. They are able to use these tokens to participate in governance, issuing, validating and staking on the Dock Network.

**Dock Association Treasury**

An additional 15% of Dock tokens comprise the Dock Association's treasury and are used to fund development, operations, and marketing of the Dock network. Initially, the Dock Association's Board will decide how to spend the treasury on behalf of the network. As the network becomes more decentralized, token holders will be able to vote on how treasury funds are spent.

**Emission Rewards**

The Dock Association has committed 150M \(15% of total supply\) to emission rewards which will be released over time on the Dock mainnet. This release will be launched in 2 phases; the first phase is Proof of Authority \(PoA\) where Dock's governing council will select validators based on the validators testnet performance. The second is Proof of Stake \(PoS\) where validators will be selected on the basis of their staked tokens. For more detail on each phase please check the respective documents.
