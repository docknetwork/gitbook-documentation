# Migration FAQ

{% hint style="info" %}
Dock has officially completed the token migration as of **March 31, 2021**. Any questions can be sent to [support@dock.io](mailto:support@dock.io).
{% endhint %}

#### Why did Dock migrate the token?

Dock initially planned to build its protocol using Ethereum and issued the DOCK token using an ERC20 contract. After extensive R\&D with Ethereum, the Dock team proposed to move to another network and the community voted to move to the Polkadot interchain ecosystem. Dock has since launched its own blockchain with a  mainnet supported by 11 independent validators. The Dock token was migrated from an ERC20 token to a native token on Dockâ€™s blockchain in order to facilitate transactions, reward validators, governance, and eventually staking on the Dock Network. &#x20;



#### Which wallets support the new DOCK tokens?

ERC20 wallets will not support the new Dock token, instead holders will have several options for their new Dock tokens:

* [Polkadot-JS app](https://fe.dock.io/#/accounts) is a well-used and tested browser-based wallet that the Dock team has forked and customized for the Dock network. **This is the recommended wallet for most non-technical users.**
* [Parity signer](https://www.parity.io/signer/) can be used for key storage on a mobile device, for extra security the mobile device should be kept offline.&#x20;
* [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledger.com/) is a hard wallet and will be supporting the new Dock token soon, the team is submitting a pull request to Ledger to enable new DOCK tokens to be stored on Ledger Nano S in the coming weeks.



#### What was the timeline for the token migration?

The Dock token migration began on December 8, 2020, and continued for three months until midnight (GMT) March 31, 2021.&#x20;



#### Did exchanges migrate the token?

If your Dock tokens were held on any of the following exchanges, there is no action required and these exchanges migrated your tokens on your behalf:

* Binance
* Huobi
* Kucoin
* BKEX
* Gate.io

More information about the supporting exchanges can be found [here](https://blog.dock.io/token-migration-part-3/). If you have questions about migrating with an exchange, please contact the exchange directly. If you hold Dock tokens on an exchange that is not listed here, then you will need to migrate your tokens directly with Dock as described [here](https://docs.dock.io/token-migration/migration-tutorial/migration-tutorial). \


#### How can I check if the migration was successful?

You can check the status of your migration by going to our Token Migration portal and entering the Ethereum address where you sent your ERC20 tokens from and the transaction hash. Once the migration is complete, your new Dock tokens will be available in your new Dock account.
