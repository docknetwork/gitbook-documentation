# Setup accounts for staking

{% hint style="warning" %}
Staking will launch on the Dock network on **July 7 at 1pm GMT**. 

This article is being provided ahead of the launch for informational purposes only, you will not be able to stake until that time.

Nominators are recommended to set up separate stash and controller accounts. Explanation and reasoning for generating distinct accounts for this purpose is elaborated in the keys section of these docs.

Payouts can go to any custom address, so you are able to redirect payments to an account that is neither the controller nor the stash account. Note that it is extremely unsafe to set an exchange address as the recipient of the staking rewards.

Two types of accounts need to be setup in order to participate as a nominator on Dock and stake tokens on behalf of a validator: **Stash** and **Controller** accounts.

* **Stash accounts** are meant to hold large amounts of funds, similar to a savings account. Its private key should be as secure as possible in a cold wallet. The Stash account provides the tokens that are being staked.
* **Controller accounts** signal choices on behalf of the Stash account, like payout preferences and bonding tokens to a validator. It should only hold a minimal amount of funds to pay transaction fees.

You can have multiple Stash and Controller accounts for participating in staking. If you have not created Dock accounts already, follow the steps in the [Wallets and Account](https://docs.dock.io/help-center/help-center/wallets-and-account-creation) creation article to create at least two accounts for staking using any of the recommended methods.

Next, fund the stash wallet with the tokens you would like to stake and the controller account with a small amount of tokens to cover transaction fees.
